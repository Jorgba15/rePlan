Story 1:
A student has a lot of shit to do, but doesn't know how to schedule it in a smart way. So he/she can use the rePlan
taskplanner to get a a good overview over what to do. The student types in the tasks, and keeps them in a tidy list on a webpage that also 
works on a phone.

That's pretty much how the planner will be used.
